# MERLOT PDF Generation Service
The MERLOT PDF Service is a microservice for generating PDF files for a given JSON input.

Currently this service supports the generation of a contract PDF given the provided details using the REST API.


## Development

To start development for the MERLOT marketplace, please refer to [this document](https://github.com/merlot-education/.github/blob/main/Docs/DevEnv.md)
to set up a local WSL development environment of all relevant services.
This is by far the easiest way to get everything up and running locally.

## Structure

## Deploy (Docker)

This microservice can be deployed as part of the full MERLOT docker stack at
[localdeployment](https://github.com/merlot-education/localdeployment).

## Deploy (Helm)
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Helm installed and configured to the desired Kubernetes cluster.

### Setting Up Minikube (if needed)
If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster set up, you can use Minikube for local development. Follow these steps to set up Minikube:

1. **Install Minikube:**
   Follow the instructions [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to install Minikube on your machine.

2. **Start Minikube:**
   Start Minikube using the following command:
   ```
   minikube start
   ```
3. **Verify Minikube Status:**
   Check the status of Minikube to ensure it's running:   
   ```
   minikube status
   ```

### Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository containing the Helm chart:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/merlot-education/gitops.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Helm Chart:**
   Change into the directory of the Helm chart:
   ```
   cd gitops/charts/orchestrator
   ```

3. **Customize Values (if needed):**
   If you need to customize any values, modify the values.yaml file in this directory according to your requirements. This file contains configurable parameters such as image repository, tag, service ports, etc. An example containing the values used in Merlot dev environment is available in gitops/environments/dev/pdfservice.yaml

4. **Install the Chart:**
   Run the following command to install the chart from the local repository:
   ```
   helm install [RELEASE_NAME] .
   ```
   Replace [RELEASE_NAME] with the name you want to give to this deployment. In this case it can be pdfservice.

5. **Verify Deployment:**
   Check the status of your deployment using the following commands:
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl get services
   ```
